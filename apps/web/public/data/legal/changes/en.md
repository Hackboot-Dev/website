## 1. General principles

### 1.1. Service evolution rationale

VMCloud may evolve its Services for legitimate reasons that are necessary in the current technological and economic context:

**Technical reasons:** Performance improvements, component updates to address security vulnerabilities, infrastructure optimization, or migration to more modern and efficient technologies.

**Economic reasons:** Cost optimization to maintain service viability, adaptation to market changes, or offer rationalization to focus investments on the most utilized services.

**Regulatory reasons:** Compliance with new legal obligations, adaptation to security standard evolutions, or compliance with new sector constraints imposed by authorities.

**Technological reasons:** Adaptation to IT ecosystem evolutions, component obsolescence management, adoption of new innovations to improve services, or abandonment of obsolete technologies.

### 5.1. Extended notice

**Complete services:** Minimum 90 calendar days before definitive discontinuation

**Individual features:** Minimum 60 calendar days

**Versions or APIs:** 60 days for deprecations, 12 months for definitive discontinuation with transition period

### 5.2. Structured transition process

VMCloud may decide on definitive service discontinuation for economic, technical, or strategic reasons, while respecting a transparent process that protects existing client interests while preserving its operational flexibility.

**Deprecation notice:** VMCloud commits to notify affected clients with a minimum notice of 90 calendar days before definitive service discontinuation. This notification specifies the exact discontinuation date (End of Service), reasons motivating this decision, impact on affected clients, and available alternatives. Notification occurs via direct email to affected clients, status page publication, and management interface notification.

**Transition period:** During the 90-day notice period, the service remains fully operational and maintained according to its usual SLAs. No new subscriptions are accepted from the deprecation announcement, but existing clients retain all their contractual rights until the effective discontinuation date.

**Proposed migration plans:** VMCloud systematically proposes migration paths to equivalent or superior services from its catalog, maintaining pricing conditions for a minimum of 6 months to facilitate transition. If no equivalent service exists in the VMCloud catalog, recommendations to third-party providers may be provided for informational purposes, without VMCloud engaging its responsibility.

**Dedicated technical support:** During the transition period, specialized technical support is made available free of charge to accompany clients in their migration. This support includes assistance with data export, new service configuration, and resolution of technical problems related to migration. Detailed migration guides and automated tools are developed when technically possible.

**Refunds and compensation:** Prepaid amounts not consumed at the discontinuation date are fully refunded or transferred to newly subscribed services. In case of proven significant inconvenience caused by service discontinuation, VMCloud may offer commercial compensation (credits, discounts, additional services) calculated case by case.
