## 1. General Principles

The Client undertakes to use services in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to respect the rights of third parties. VMCloud enforces a strict acceptable use policy.

## 2. Explicit Prohibitions

VMCloud maintains a strict policy regarding prohibited uses of its services, with four main categories of prohibitions that reflect both our legal obligations and our commitment to gaming integrity and cybersecurity.

### 2.1. Circumvention and Cheating Activities

VMCloud maintains an uncompromising stance against any form of video game cheating and technological circumvention. This policy reflects our commitment to gaming integrity and our categorical refusal to facilitate unfair practices. All video game cheat software is formally prohibited without exception, whether it involves automated cheats, bots, aimbots that automate aiming, or ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) that reveals hidden information in games. Our position is particularly firm on this point: any detection of gaming or cheat activity results in an immediate warning, and in case of recurrence, a permanent suspension without refund. This radical measure is justified by the fact that VMCloud offers legitimate cloud gaming services, and we cannot tolerate any activity that would compromise the integrity of this ecosystem.

The prohibition extends to any installation of games on our virtual machines, even for legitimate personal use. This rule without exception ensures that no circumvention can be performed under the guise of normal usage. Circumvention of technical protection measures represents a serious violation: this includes bypassing anti-cheat systems from game publishers, disabling DRM (Digital Rights Management), or any attempt to circumvent protections implemented by developers. Identity spoofing also constitutes a prohibited practice, whether it involves falsifying IP addresses, MAC addresses, or manipulating hardware fingerprinting to deceive detection systems. Exploiting vulnerabilities in online games to gain unfair advantages is strictly prohibited, as are boosting services, automated leveling, or ranking manipulation that corrupts competitive fairness.

### 2.2. Malicious Activities

VMCloud adopts zero tolerance towards any form of malicious activity. Computer attacks are formally prohibited, including DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, stressers and booters that aim to overload third-party servers, or any other type of denial of service. Hosting malware, viruses, ransomware, or any malicious software constitutes a major violation that exposes VMCloud and its clients to considerable legal and technical risks. Command & Control (C2) infrastructures used to operate botnets are strictly prohibited as they participate in organized criminal networks. All forms of phishing, online scams, financial fraud, or attempted swindling are prohibited. Finally, unauthorized exploitation of vulnerabilities, whether on our systems or on third-party services accessible from our infrastructure, constitutes a serious violation of our AUP.

### 2.3. Abusive Network Usage

VMCloud carefully monitors the use of its network resources to detect abusive behavior. Massive unauthorized port scans, particularly those aimed at identifying vulnerabilities on third-party systems, are strictly prohibited as they can be considered attack reconnaissance. Aggressive network reconnaissance, including systematic attempts to map infrastructures without authorization, is also prohibited.

The use of VPNs and proxies is subject to specific restrictions: if these services are not included in the subscribed offer, their installation and use on our servers are formally prohibited. The client can connect to their server via VPN from their workstation, but installing a VPN or proxy server directly on VMCloud infrastructure requires explicit prior authorization and may result in additional charges. This restriction aims to preserve the integrity of our network and comply with our legal obligations towards competent authorities.

Any form of spam or unsolicited mass sending is prohibited, whether emails, messages, or any other type of communication, although practical limits are determined by the quotas of subscribed services. Violation of third-party Internet Service Provider policies, which could compromise our relationships with our network partners, also constitutes a prohibited practice.

### 2.4. Commercial Circumvention

This last category aims to preserve the integrity of our commercial relationships and respect for intellectual property rights. Unauthorized resale of VMCloud services without an official partnership agreement is formally prohibited, as it compromises our economic model and can create poorly defined liability situations. Violation of the terms of use of third-party services hosted on our infrastructure can expose VMCloud to legal claims, which is why we strictly prohibit it. Circumvention of software licenses, whether proprietary software or SaaS solutions, constitutes a violation of intellectual property that we do not tolerate.

Cryptocurrency mining is strictly prohibited on all VMCloud infrastructure. This absolute prohibition stems from significant performance impacts, excessive energy consumption, and overheating risks generated by this activity. Any detection of mining activity, whether obvious or concealed, results in sanctions proportional to the severity and duration of the violation. Depending on the duration and intensity of the detected activity, measures can range from a simple warning with billing of additional energy costs to permanent suspension without refund for the most serious cases. This inflexible policy ensures performance fairness for all our clients and preserves the integrity of our infrastructure.

## 3. Enforcement Procedure

VMCloud implements active and continuous monitoring of compliance with its acceptable use policy, relying on an advanced technological approach combined with rigorous human processes. Our detection and reporting system is based on three complementary pillars that ensure comprehensive coverage of potential violations.

### 3.1. Detection and Reporting

Our automated detection systems analyze in real-time traffic patterns, software signatures, and suspicious behaviors through machine learning algorithms and regularly updated signature databases. These systems automatically detect cheating activities, DDoS attacks, malware hosting, or unauthorized network scans. In parallel, we scrupulously process all third-party reports, whether they come from game publishers, other service providers, or cybersecurity organizations via our abuse@vmcloud.com address. These abuse reports are subject to thorough investigation by our security team which verifies the validity of accusations and collects necessary technical evidence. Finally, our proactive monitoring involves targeted surveillance of suspicious uses identified by our technical teams, with in-depth investigations that may include log analysis, configuration examination, and event correlation.

### 3.2. Escalation of Measures

VMCloud applies a proportionate approach in handling violations, with four escalation levels adapted to the severity and recurrence of infractions. Notification always constitutes the first step when severity allows: we contact the client to inform them of the detected violation, explain associated risks and expected corrective measures, while specifying the time granted to regularize the situation. This notification often includes technical advice and resources to help the client understand and resolve the problem. If the violation persists or worsens, we proceed to targeted limitation of resources or functionalities: bandwidth reduction, limitation of simultaneous connections, deactivation of certain network functionalities, or access restriction to certain geographical areas. This measure aims to contain impact while preserving legitimate client activities. Partial suspension occurs when limitation proves insufficient: we isolate services from the public network while maintaining client access to their data via the management console, thus allowing them to correct the situation or export their information. Finally, total suspension results in immediate and complete service shutdown, reserved for the most serious violations or recidivists.

### 3.3. Cure Periods

The time granted to remedy violations varies according to the criticality of the situation and associated risks. For non-critical uses, such as minor violations of terms of use or configuration problems, we systematically grant 48 hours to the client to comply with our requirements. This period allows the client to understand the problem, identify causes, and implement necessary corrections without haste. However, for critical uses that involve the security of our infrastructure, the legality of our services, or public order, we proceed to immediate suspension without notice or cure period. This emergency measure particularly concerns active computer attacks, hosting of illegal content, proven cybercriminal activities, or any situation that exposes VMCloud or its clients to immediate legal or technical risks.

## 4. Penetration Testing and Responsible Disclosure Program

VMCloud maintains a strict but constructive approach regarding the security of its infrastructure, encouraging responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities while protecting its systems against unauthorized testing.

### 4.1. Unauthorized Penetration Testing

All penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, or exploitation attempts not previously authorized are strictly prohibited on VMCloud infrastructure and third-party services accessible from our systems. These activities constitute a serious violation of our AUP and are subject to immediate sanctions, including suspension without notice and reporting to competent authorities.

### 4.2. Responsible Disclosure Program

VMCloud encourages responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities by researchers and the security community. Discovered vulnerabilities must be reported exclusively via security@vmcloud.com with a detailed description, non-destructive proof of concept, and the researcher's commitment to respect our coordinated disclosure policy.

### 4.3. Authorized Testing

Security testing on our infrastructure requires explicit prior authorization obtained via security@vmcloud.com. The request must include the complete identity of the researcher, the precise technical scope of envisioned tests, detailed methodology, desired time window, accepted limitations, and formal commitment to responsible disclosure. VMCloud reserves the right to accept or refuse any request according to its internal criteria.

### 4.4. Correction Timeframes

VMCloud commits to processing reported vulnerabilities according to their criticality: critical vulnerabilities (data exposure, RCE) within 48 hours, important vulnerabilities (privilege escalation, security bypass) within 7 days, medium vulnerabilities (information disclosure, DoS) within 30 days, and minor vulnerabilities (configuration, best practices) within 90 days. These timeframes constitute quality objectives and not contractual obligations.

### 4.5. Rewards Program

VMCloud may, at its sole discretion, offer financial or non-financial rewards to researchers who have significantly contributed to improving our security. These rewards never constitute an obligation and depend on vulnerability criticality, report quality, and compliance with our disclosure policy.

## 5. Adult Content Policy

VMCloud maintains a balanced approach regarding adult content, based on transparency, mandatory prior notification, and zero tolerance for any illegal content. This policy aims to protect VMCloud from any legal risk while respecting the legitimate freedom of use of our clients.

### 5.1. Mandatory Prior Notification

Any client wishing to use our services to store or distribute adult content must imperatively inform us before use. This notification applies to object storage when the main content consists of pornographic or adult images or videos, as well as hosting websites or services offering adult content. Notification must be made via support@vmcloud.com specifying the nature of the content, intended use, and access protection measures implemented. This transparency allows us to adapt our security measures and comply with applicable regulations.

### 5.2. Legal Adult Content

VMCloud does not prohibit legal adult content, provided it scrupulously respects laws in force and is subject to mandatory prior notification. The client remains solely responsible for ensuring the legality of their content and implementing appropriate access control measures, particularly age verification and regulatory warnings.

### 5.3. Zero Tolerance for Illegal Content

In case of hosting illegal adult content, particularly content involving minors, zoophilia, sexual violence, or any non-consensual content, VMCloud applies a policy of immediate suspension without refund and proceeds to immediate notification of competent authorities with transmission of all client identification information.

## 6. Inspection Procedure on Suspicion

VMCloud scrupulously respects its clients' privacy and does not perform any systematic preventive inspection of stored data or hosted services. However, we reserve the right to inspect content in exceptional circumstances and with prior notification to the client.

### 6.1. Inspection Circumstances

Our inspection right is exercised only in case of well-founded report by a third party, complaint filed by a person alleging the presence of content concerning them without their consent, or legitimate suspicion of illegal activity based on objective elements. This inspection never concerns client personal data but only stored or distributed content.

### 6.2. Transparent Procedure

When an inspection proves necessary, VMCloud notifies the client of its intentions by explaining the reasons motivating this approach and specifying the scope of the envisioned inspection. The client then has 48 hours to provide explanations, bring proof elements of their content's legality, or grant voluntary access to concerned elements.

### 6.3. Preventive Suspension and Follow-up

In case of serious suspicion concerning potentially illegal content, VMCloud may proceed to temporary preventive suspension during the investigation. If inspection actually reveals the presence of illegal content with conclusive evidence, VMCloud proceeds to permanent suspension without refund, preserves evidence for judicial authorities, and immediately transmits client identification information to competent authorities. If inspection reveals that suspicions were unfounded, VMCloud immediately restores services and may offer a commercial gesture to compensate for the inconvenience caused.

## 7. Evidence Retention

VMCloud retains evidence of violations for a minimum of 12 months for legal and defense purposes.
